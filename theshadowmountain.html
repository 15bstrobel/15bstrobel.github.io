						The Website Is Made (Sort of)!

						Thanksgiving break gave me the edge I needed to finally overcome my homework
						deficit and get started on this website! Yesterday I built the layout of
						the website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I deliberated over how my website
						would look on a mobile device (try it out!). That took a lot of work, because
						this is my first time working with CSS and I don't quite understand some
						of its features. I had to mess around with margins and padding a lot to get the
						look I was going for. Even then, it's still just a grey background with a simple
						color scheme.<br><br>
						
						Even ignoring the simplistic design, this website is far from complete,
						if only because it <em>consists of a single page</em>. Today I will be working
						on adding a blog page (this page!), and the pages for each of my games. Since today
						is Thanksgiving, I may not get the opportunity to do this until nighttime, once 
						dinner is over.<br><br>
						
						I think in my next entry I will establish some goals for this website and the blog,
						and give an overview of my current plan and direction in game development.
