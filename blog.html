						Joining the Center for Game Science
					</div>

					<div class="blog-body">
						December saw a lot of changes for my plans, the most significant being my 
						decision to work the UW's Center for Game Science. This will be an awesome opportunity for 
						me to work with game developers and gain semi-professional experience. The game I will be 
						working on is <a href="http://nanocrafter.org">Nanocrafter</a>, which is a puzzle game based
						off of synthetic biology (specifically, how DNA strands interact with each other). This is 
						very exciting to me because it's a pretty fun way to learn about synthetic biology. Seriously, 
						try playing it, I thought it was fun. The current push is to refactor the code and improve
						some of the games features. <br><br>
						
						This means my other ideas will be on hold. I currently have two other projects on deck: A JavaScript
						RPG game, and a electrical circuit sandbox game. I will complete these over the summer. The Brick
						Pong team lost a lot of steam last quarter, so it looks like a dead project. Later on I might
						consider going back and finishing it. <br><br>
						
						Anyway, Nanocrafter was made in ActionScript 3.0, which seems like an old programming language. The
						last time it was updated was in 2006. Yet, ActionScript seems to be pretty powerful and 
						a pretty good choice for game development. Every software developer and game
						developer I've talked to didn't even mention ActionScript when I asked them what languages
						are useful in today's industry. Regardless, I took some time over break to make a 
						<a href="pong.html">pong game</a>
						with ActionScript to get myself familiar with it. It was actually a lot of fun. I'm excited
						to work with the Center for Game Science this quarter.

						RPG Maker MV
					</div>

					</div>
					<div class="blog-body">
						On my page for <a href="theshadowmountain.html"><em>The Shadow Mountain</em></a> I
						mentioned how I felt RPG Maker VX had a limited scope. It did. It still does. But
						Enterbrain's latest release, <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-mv">RPG Maker MV</a>, is
						orders of magnitude better (an intermediate release, RPG Maker VX Ace, was pretty good too, but MV 
						is even better). I played around with the trial version last night, and it improved tons of 
						things I hated in RPG Maker VX. I was so impressed that I decided to 
						share my thoughts on it to my blog. <br><br>
						
						RPG Maker MV exports to iOS, Android, WebGL, OSX, and Windows. An <em>incredible</em> improvement from
						RPG Maker VX's only export option being Windows. It also uses JavaScript instead of Ruby now. I'm not quite proficient in 
						either of those languages, but from what I saw at Dubhacks, JavaScript is quite popular, with things like angular and node.js.
						xkcd even made a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1508/">cartoon</a> suggesting that in 2020 we'll have operating systems ending in .js.
						If xkcd counts as a credible source, then Enterbrain is right there on the cutting
						edge of technology.  
						<br><br>
						
						The fact it can make games playable
						in-browser on a mobile device is really impressive. That's something Unity can't do very well. (Unity can export
						to WebGL but it's still in beta and builds don't quite work as expected) In case the
						implications of that aren't clear, <em>RPG Maker MV had an advantage over Unity</em>. There are also tons of new tools in the RPG Maker MV editor, making things I had wished possible with RPG Maker VX 
						now simple matters. Easy plug-in support, a character generator, terrain tags, more freedom with iconsets and tilesets, a clearer battle
						system, more flexible passibility settings, and a built in caterpillar party system are just some of the improvements. <br><br>
						
						I don't think I will ever use RPG Maker MV to seriously make games, though. It's for a very specific 
						game genre, and I need full flexibility for my ideas. Still, well done Enterbrain. I was thoroughly impressed 
						with MV. Maybe once I'm past the years of frantically maintaining a high enough grade point average to get into UW's computer science program I'll 
						set aside some time and make an RPG Maker game for fun.

						Eighteen out of Twenty
					</div>
					<div class="blog-date">
						11/28/15 12:02 AM
					</div>
					<div class="blog-body">
						My computer science professor used the phrase "eighteen out of twenty" to 
						describe why Java's syntax for Array length and String length is different 
						(.length vs. .length()). The developers of Java made a small mistake; two groups
						had created different conventions. But they were tired, and getting an 18/20 on the
						"assignment" of making Java was good enough. I think my professor was trying to
						describe it in terms that a college student would understand: the makers of Java
						felt it was good enough and were too tired to put in the extra effort for a mere
						two points. <br><br>
						
						Personally, I agonize over missing 2 points on an assignment. But honestly, with this
						website, I'd have to say I'm okay with 18/20. It's actually probably closer to 14/20, 
						because of internal issues that I will explain further down. Now if I was a
						successful, rich, popular developer, I would aim for 20/20. But perfection
						isn't important just yet because <em>this is a learning experience more than anything else</em>. Rather than try to get
						 everything perfect the first time, I'm going to focus on improving my abilities, which in
						 turn will organically invoke improvement on my actual projects. <br><br>
						 
						 So what needs to be improved? Take a look at the source files for this site 
						 (the CSS file too). They are unorganized, cluttered, redundant, and inconsistent. AND, my blogging
						 system is just adding more text to the blog.html webpage. This
							blog post was literally typed into the 
						 HTML file. It's not terrible I suppose, <em>but what if I changed the template?</em> What if I redesigned
						the HTML containing the blog posts? I would have to go back through each post and 
						change it. Same with the navigation bar, the header, the footer, and the meta data on each
						page. Typing everything by hand only works until you need to change something. <br><br>
						
						The solution is to write a program that takes an HTML template file and
						several text source files, and generates the website. I think this is what <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">
						Jekyll</a> does. I could learn how to use Jekyll, but it will be more fun and more educational
						if I write the program myself. Rather than limiting myself to knowing how to generate websites
						with a specific program, I can unravel the concepts myself, ensuring that I will be able to 
						do the same thing 10 years from now when Jekyll is outdated. <br><br>
						
						Tomorrow I need to return to homework, research and studying, so for now, typing the blogs directly
						into the HTML file is going to have
						to be acceptable.

						Getting a Playable Game Online
					</div>
					<div class="blog-date">

					</div>
					<div class="blog-body">
						I made tons of progress with the website. It's still fairly simplistic, but 
						I'm happy with the overall appearance of it, especially the Super Smash Pong
						page because I was able to upload the game, and <em>it is currently playable on
						the website</em>. How awesome is that?!? I was very excited to see an actual game that is playable
						on a live website that I made. That is something I've never done before. I had to tweak the build
						settings and play around with some HTML and JS that I didn't fully understand, but the game fits nicely into
						the webpage. <br><br>
						
						I tried uploading FBLA Antivirus as well, since it's also a Unity game, but
						I didn't build it correctly. It's a long story, but basically I built it while
						in my dorm, took the USB drive to my cousin's house, and tried adding it to my
						website there. However the viewport is all messed up. So, I need to return to my
						laptop and build the game with the correct settings. But I left my laptop in my dorm, so I can't fix this until tomorrow evening, when I
						return. <br><br>
						
						My next goal is to get all my games onto the website, including the downloadable
						versions. In theory this shouldn't be too difficult. All I need to do is
						add the files to the repository and include links and screenshots on the games'
						respective pages. After that, my next task will be to write a Java program 
						that generates my HTML pages using templates and source files. This will give
						me greater flexibility and make it less of a hassle when I decide I want to 
						redesign this website (let's be honest, it looks awful right now).

						The Website Is Made (Sort Of)!

					<div class="blog-body">
						Thanksgiving break gave me the edge I needed to finally overcome my homework
						deficit and get started on this website! Yesterday I built the layout of
						the website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I deliberated over how my website
						would look on a mobile device (try it out!). That took a lot of work, because
						this is my first time working with CSS and I don't quite understand some
						of its features. I had to mess around with margins and padding a lot to get the
						look I was going for. Even then, it's still just a grey background with a simple
						color scheme.<br><br>
						
						Even ignoring the simplistic design, this website is far from complete,
						if only because it <em>consists of a single page</em>. Today I will be working
						on adding a blog page (this page!), and the pages for each of my games. Since today
						is Thanksgiving, I may not get the opportunity to do this until nighttime, once 
						dinner is over.
