						Getting a Playable Game Online

						I made tons of progress with the website. It's still fairly simplistic, but 
						I'm happy with the overall appearance of it, especially the Super Smash Pong
						page because I was able to upload the game, and it is currently playable on
						the website. I had to tweak the build settings and play around with some
						HTML and JS that I didn't fully understand, but the game fits nicely into
						the webpage. <br><br>
						
						I tried uploading FBLA Antivirus as well, since it's also a Unity game, but
						I didn't build it correctly. It's a long story, but basically I built it while
						in my dorm, took the USB drive to my cousin's house, and tried adding it to my
						website there. However the viewport is all messed up, AND I left the laptop with
						the Unity project at my dorm, so I can't fix this until tomorrow evening, when I
						return to my dorm. <br><br>
						
						My next goal is to get all my games onto the website, including the downloadable
						versions. In theory this shouldn't be too difficult. All I need to do is
						add the files to the repository and include links and screenshots on the games'
						respective pages. After that, my next task will be to write a Java program 
						that generates my HTML pages using templates and source files. This will give
						me greater flexibility and make it less of a hassle when I decide I want to 
						redesign this website (let's be honest, it looks awful right now).

						The Website Is Made (Sort Of)!

						Thanksgiving break gave me the edge I needed to finally overcome my homework
						deficit and get started on this website! Yesterday I built the layout of
						the website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I deliberated over how my website
						would look on a mobile device (try it out!). That took a lot of work, because
						this is my first time working with CSS and I don't quite understand some
						of its features. I had to mess around with margins and padding a lot to get the
						look I was going for. Even then, it's still just a grey background with a simple
						color scheme.<br><br>
						
						Even ignoring the simplistic design, this website is far from complete,
						if only because it <em>consists of a single page</em>. Today I will be working
						on adding a blog page (this page!), and the pages for each of my games. Since today
						is Thanksgiving, I may not get the opportunity to do this until nighttime, once 
						dinner is over.
