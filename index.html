						Today I finished making a very, very, very rough 
						version of this website. It has one page, this
						single entry, and no games. And the color scheme
						is grey and white. But this is definitely progress.
						I had to struggle around with CSS and HTML. I still
						don't quite understand positioning fully, but 
						I managed to create a decent looking layout.
						Maybe some color or pictures will be next. Yes

								There is a very pretty girl named Hana. We talk a lot in History. I am worried that she will 
								friendzone me because I haven't really asked her on a date and I probably missed my
								chance. It doesn't matter too much, though, because it is just cool that I've found a f
								friend in the first place. I can always find another girl and keep Hana as a friend if she 
								doesn't want to date me.
