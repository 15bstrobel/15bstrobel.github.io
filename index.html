						Welcome to my website, where you can freely browse my thoughts
						and see what projects I'm working on. My name's Brian Strobel and
						I'm a student at UW. My current priority is to get accepted into
						the computer science program here, so I'm starting this website
						to keep track of all the projects I've done, and distribute them in
						a smooth, polished way (although this website doesn't look very
						smooth right now).
						<br><br>
						I have some ambitious goals for game development that I will probably
						still be pursuing 10 years from now. I've always been interested in the 
						MMORPG genre, however I lack the vital skills and resources needed
						to implement my idea, so I've planned out several smaller projects
						that will get me where I need to be. In particular I am going to 
						attempt to use Google's FireBase to implement a turn based online
						game, which will be hosted on this website.
						<br><br>
						I am also going to start keeping a blog. Topics will be about whatever
						feel like discussing, but it's going to be largely centered on game 
						development. I'd like to "chart my progress" so that A: I can look
						back and laugh at my former self, and B: other people who are 
						currently in my position will have a guide and could possibly use 
						my blog as a starting point for their game-development-skill-getting.
						<br><br>
						Helping others down the murky roads of game development is especially
						important to me because if you ask about multiplayer game
						development on Stack Exchange or any other website, you get shut 
						down immediately; their answer is always "You can't. No. Don't do it. Impossible."
						This was one of the main reasons I was discouraged from game development
						in high school, so I hope that people will listen to the advice on my
						blog, instead of the advice from Stack Exchange to give up.
						<br><br>
						Okay, I'm done rambling. Since I will be updating this soon, no 
						one is ever going to read this anyway...

						Today I finished making a very, very, very rough 
						version of this website. It has one page, this
						single entry, and no games. And the color scheme
						is grey and white. But this is definitely progress.
						I had to struggle around with CSS and HTML. I still
						don't quite understand positioning fully, but 
						I managed to create a decent looking layout.
						Maybe some color or pictures will be next. Yes
